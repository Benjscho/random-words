# random-words

This is a quick function that pulls an optional number of random words from a text file and prints them to the console. The words included in this project were taken from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.

To run this from the command line generating x number of words:
'''sh
python3 random-words.py x
'''

If run without a value for x, the default value is 1.
